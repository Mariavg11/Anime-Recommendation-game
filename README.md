 We created an anime Recommendation system which is a GUI that uses tkinter in python.
Our GUI consists of a questionnaire leading to recommended anime,based on the user's answers, our system will be able to determine a list of 5 or more animes as a recommendation. 

Our starting page will appear, for the user to start the game they must press, “press play!” button to start. leading to our first frame where the system will start asking questions. In the second frame they will have to choose  between two options: either a list of anime based on their preference or receive every anime recommendation(A or B).
-If option a was selected our warning sign will show warning the user that since they choose  random anime meaning that the content of some animes can contain  violent  or Inappropriate scenes. If the user agrees to continue the game a list of anime will appear, this list will contain: Title,Episodes,Seasons, An image of the anime, and lastly a description of each anime.

-If option B was selected, our game will continue asking questions regarding your interest, the 4th frame will appear asking the user to choose a genre
(Horror,Sports,Mystery and Slice of life.Comedy) 
Following a  frame where it would ask the user how long they would prefer their anime between three sizes (short 12 and lower, medium 25-40, and long 50+) this would give the user options to choose their preferred length.
Another warning sign will should up asking the user if they're okay with gore/sexual scenes. If they are okay with it, the system will take them to our final frame where they will press another button “lets Go!” to generate anime recommendations.

Throughout the game you'll see the colorful background where we imported images to  
To build our code we utilize: Frames,Button,Images,Labels, and Variables where the user is able to click,choose, and generate their recommended anime.
